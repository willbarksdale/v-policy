# v – Terminal-Based Vibe Coding

**Code anywhere. Your server, your AI, your way.**

A privacy-first mobile IDE that connects to your SSH server, letting you vibe code with CLI-based AI tools like Gemini CLI, Qwen CLI, Claude Code, and more. Generate projects, write code, and preview results—all from your phone.

## What It Does

**v** transforms your phone into an AI-powered terminal workspace:

1. **Connect via SSH** to your own server (BYOS - Bring Your Own Server)
2. **Use CLI AI tools** to generate and build projects through the terminal
3. **Run commands** with full terminal access and multi-tab support
4. **Preview live** with built-in WebView for instant feedback

No desktop IDE needed. Just SSH, terminal, AI CLI tools, and preview.
